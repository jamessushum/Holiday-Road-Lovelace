## Overview

This app is an easy to use trip creator allowing our user to create a trip starting in Nashville, TN that will take them to any National Park in the U.S. When the user accesses the site they will begin at "Start Your Adventure Here" to select a state they want to go to, then a drop down of available parks in that state becomes available. Once a park is selected, the user can then choose an attraction, and restaurant as pit stops. The user is given preview options, and can select a "Details" button. If a details button is chosen, the user is able to see a description of the park, restaurant, or attraction chosen. The user has the option to name and save the trip once details have been chosen. As soon as a park is chosen the user can see the 5 day forecast, and also a map with detailed directions for the trip. The user is able to see any trips they have saved in the top right of the page.
